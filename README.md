Module 9 â€“ Homework 7 - JavaScript and Web Design

I had all sorts of problems with this assignment. I still can't seem to grasp how to use .getElementsByClass or .querySelectorAll. I'm obviously doing something very fundamentally wrong and can't figure out what it is.

Unfortunately, I cheated... well, techically its probably correct, but NOT best practice on activating the grid hovers.
